Speaker UNK: Let's just finish.
Speaker A: Maybe. Yes.
Speaker UNK: Or you will talk about Spotify.
Speaker A: I really like Spotify. I can't live without it. Right? You agree?
Speaker UNK: You were talking to someone?
Speaker A: Yes. I am talking to someone that is beside me. So Spotify is amazing. They have really good music there and really good recommendations. I really like it. You don't like it? No. Okay, I like it. Only my opinion matters. Okay. It's my word, my rules. But I think should be completely free.
