# Contributing to the Sentiment Analysis API

We welcome contributions to this project! To help you get started, here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to this repository.

## How the Project is Structured

This project follows a layered architecture for better maintainability and readability. When contributing, please follow the conventions for each layer.

### 1. Data Layer

**What to Modify:**
- Code related to fetching and storing data (e.g., external API calls, database interactions).
- If you're adding a new data source or modifying an existing one, this is the layer to focus on.

**Things to Keep in Mind:**
- Ensure data validation and error handling is implemented correctly.
- Keep data access logic isolated from other layers to promote separation of concerns.

### 2. Model Layer

**What to Modify:**
- The logic for processing or transforming data.
- If you're adding new business logic, algorithms, or data models, they should go here.

**Things to Keep in Mind:**
- Follow existing naming conventions for model classes.
- Ensure that business logic is encapsulated in the model layer and kept separate from data access logic.

### 3. Service Layer

**What to Modify:**
- Code that orchestrates the interaction between the model and the routes layer.
- If you're adding new services like sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, or any other domain-specific functionality, this is the place to do it.

**Things to Keep in Mind:**
- Ensure that services are reusable and abstracted from the route layer.
- Keep service methods focused on specific tasks (e.g., text analysis, API calls, etc.).

### 4. Routes Layer

**What to Modify:**
- The routes that define the API endpoints.
- If you’re adding a new API route or modifying an existing one, this is the layer where you’ll define the new or updated route.

**Things to Keep in Mind:**
- Routes should handle HTTP requests, pass data to services, and return appropriate responses.
- Ensure all routes are documented clearly, and handle errors gracefully.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**: Fork the project to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a branch**: Always create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/add-sentiment-service` or `bugfix/fix-model-validation`).
3. **Make changes**: Implement your changes to the appropriate layer following the guidelines above.
4. **Write Tests**:
   - Ensure that you write unit and integration tests for the new functionality or bug fixes.
   - Unit tests should be placed in the corresponding test directories under `/tests/unit/`.
   - Integration tests should be placed in `/tests/integration/`.
5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message explaining what was changed and why.
6. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository and create a pull request (PR) to the main repository.
7. **Review and Feedback**: The project maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. Please be open to changes and follow the feedback.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide.
- Write clear, descriptive docstrings for functions and classes.
- Ensure that your code is well-tested and passes all tests before submitting a pull request.

## Why This Structure Helps

By following the structure outlined above, contributors will ensure the project maintains a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future. Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality, and changes should be made to the appropriate layer.
